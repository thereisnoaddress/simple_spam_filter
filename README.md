# simple_spam_filter
Simple bayesian spam filter using NLTK

*Introduction*

This Python program takes a string (or message, editable in the code) as input and determines if it is spam or not spam (ham). The program uses NLTK to filter out stopwords and punctuations and for tokenizing words in a long message. 

*Running*

To run the program, run

    python spam_filter
    
and then type or copy in the message you want to check when the program prompts you to.

*References*

This email-filtering program uses training data from the [the SpamAssassin Public Corpus](http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/) as training data and follows the guide in chapter 3 of Machine Learning for Hackers by Drew Conway and John Myles White.
